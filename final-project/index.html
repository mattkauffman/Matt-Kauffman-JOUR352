                        For generations, Lars Miguel Utsi’s family has lived in the small town of Jokkmokk in northern
                        Sweden, where reindeer husbandry is a way of life. In a part of the world where most of us would
                        see just an endless expanse of white snow, Utsi perceives the landscape in intricate detail,
                        recognizing subtle features of the frozen terrain so vital to his livelihood.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Sámi, Europe’s only recognized Indigenous group, have lived here for thousands of years, and
                        their language reflects deep ties to the land. The nine Sámi languages still in use have an
                        extensive vocabulary for snow — everything from åppås, untouched winter snow without tracks; to
                        habllek, a light, airy dust-like snow; and tjaevi, flakes that stick together and are hard to
                        dig.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Their terminology to describe reindeer is even more intricate and is used to classify the
                        animals according to sex, age, color, fertility, tameness and more. For example, a reandi is a
                        male reindeer with long antlers, ruvggáladat is a reindeer that has run away from the herd, and
                        čearpmat-eadni is “a female reindeer that has lost its calf of the same year but is accompanied
                        by the previous year’s calf.”

                        But reindeer herders like Utsi have noticed how quickly their language is fading alongside their
                        changing landscape. Though Northern Sámi is his mother tongue, he is keenly aware of the gaps in
                        his vocabulary — words that don’t seem to make it from one generation to another. “When you talk
                        to someone older today, they have a richer language. They have more words about nature, about
                        formations in nature, animals and reindeer especially. They certainly have more snow words,”
                        said Utsi, who is also a former chair of the language board and vice president of the Sámi
                        Parliament of Sweden. “It’s a source of sorrow for me.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One word especially demonstrates what is at stake: the Northern Sámi word ealát, which Utsi said
                        could be loosely translated as “the ideal conditions for reindeer to find lichen to graze.” It’s
                        the kind of word that resists translation — a complex term that implies that a variety of
                        factors (plants, snow, geography, lichens and reindeer) have all come together in harmony. But
                        nowadays, “it’s used less and less because we don’t see those conditions that much anymore,”
                        Utsi told me.

                        Jokkmokk is a major center of reindeer husbandry in Sweden in a region known as Sápmi, which
                        covers portions of northern Norway, Sweden, Finland and the Murmansk Oblast in Russia. The
                        Indigenous Sámi people here are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change:
                        Scientists say the Arctic is warming nearly four times faster than the rest of the world.

                        Over centuries, the reindeer have adapted to the region’s harsh climatic conditions, developing
                        shovel-like hooves that help them dig for lichen and other plants hidden beneath the snow. But
                        as temperatures rise, creating more rain than snow, the ground has turned icy and made it
                        impossible for the reindeer to dig through. Early snowmelt causes abnormal seasonal floods,
                        forming barriers to herding and destroying the food supply. Studies have found that in the last
                        century, reindeer habitats have decreased by 70%, caused in part by man-made flooding for
                        hydroelectric dams. These changes threaten both wildlife and the cultural practices of reindeer
                        herding that have defined the Sámi way of life for generations.

                        At the same time, Sámi reindeer herders are fighting another battle: the loss of their
                        languages. Sweden and Finland have recently revealed plans to cut funding for the Sámi
                        Giellagáldu, a body created to safeguard and preserve Sámi languages. UNESCO regards all
                        remaining nine Sámi languages as endangered. Northern Sámi is the most widely spoken, with an
                        estimated 20,000 to 30,000 speakers, while Ume Sami is believed to have less than 50 speakers
                        left. While the causes of their decline are complex, the fading of Sámi words reflects the
                        broader erosion of their way of life. Reindeer herders like Utsi are at a literal loss for words
                        when faced with their changing environment, and this signals an uncertain future: What is left
                        when the things you have words for begin to disappear? The Sámi languages have been shaped by
                        their environment and the need for survival in harsh conditions. If they were to disappear, so
                        too could the deep knowledge and expertise that has been passed down through generations.

                    <h4>The Link Between Language and Nature</h4>
                    <p>
                        Scientists and linguists have discovered a striking connection between the world’s biodiversity
                        and its languages. Areas rich in biological diversity also tend to be rich in linguistic
                        diversity (a high concentration of languages). While this co-occurrence is not yet fully
                        understood, a strong geographic correlation suggests multiple factors (ecological, social,
                        cultural) influence both forms of diversity, which are also declining at alarming rates. These
                        high-diversity areas are also often at the front lines of the climate crisis. Where plant and
                        animal species are disappearing, languages, dialects and unique expressions often follow a
                        similar pattern of decline.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Arctic may not be an obvious biodiversity hotspot, like the Brazilian Amazon or Tanzania’s
                        coastal forests, but it plays a critical role in regulating and stabilizing the Earth’s climate
                        and supporting life on our planet. Scientists often say that “what happens in the Arctic does
                        not stay in the Arctic,” and any disruption to its habitat has far-reaching consequences for
                        humanity.

                    <p>
                        Indigenous communities have deep relationships with the land they have occupied for generations,
                        and this close relationship is reflected in the languages they speak — how they talk about the
                        landscape, and how they express the beliefs and customs in which those languages developed. When
                        their relationships with the land suffer, so can their languages.

                    <h6>
                        "Scientists warn that the climate crisis has become the 'final nail in the coffin' for many
                        indigenous languages."
                    </h6>
                    <p>
                        For example, Vanuatu, a South Pacific island nation with the highest density of languages on the
                        planet (110 languages across 4,707 square miles), is home to 138 threatened plant and animal
                        species. It is also one of the countries that is particularly vulnerable to sea level rise and
                        climate-related natural disasters. Scientists warn that the climate crisis has become the “final
                        nail in the coffin” for many Indigenous languages, as coastal communities are forced to
                        relocate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When they can no longer depend on the land, communities may be forced to emigrate to other areas
                        where their languages aren’t spoken, leaving behind not just their mother tongue, but all the
                        wisdom contained in it. There is also evidence to suggest that in cases where a language begins
                        to decline — due to economic or social factors, for example — people may gradually stop caring
                        for the land. When languages are abandoned, the traditional ecological knowledge they carry is
                        also left behind.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Our language and traditional practices are closely tied to the land,” a community leader from
                        Dishchii’bikoh, a tribally controlled school, in Cibecue, Arizona, told researchers in a 2016
                        study.“In many ways, it is used in describing objects, teaching moral lessons, and expressing
                        our purpose on this land. Since the loss of our traditional language … our traditional
                        ecological knowledge has become more and more threatened.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Increasingly, Indigenous communities are pointing to the inextricable link between language and
                        biodiversity as evidence that humans are not separate from nature, but very much a part of it.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Mapping the World's Diversity</h4>
                    <p>
                        In the early ‘90s, as conservationists were warning of the alarming decline in biodiversity,
                        linguist Luisa Maffi was studying the loss of the world’s languages, and it occurred to her that
                        these two trends may be connected. “Suddenly, it struck me: these are all forms of diversity of
                        life on Earth,” Maffi told me from her home in British Columbia. “Diversity in nature, but also
                        the diversity of human cultures and languages. They’re interrelated, interconnected and
                        interdependent. So, what is happening to one also affects what happens to the other.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She soon realized she wasn’t alone in coming to this conclusion. In 1988, the First
                        International Congress of Ethnobiology in Belém, Brazil, declared that “there is an inextricable
                        link between cultural and biological diversity.” But it was after another conference in 1995 —
                        where Maffi met David Harmon, a conservationist who had gathered data about this “converging
                        extinction crisis” — that the two founded Terralingua. According to its website, the nonprofit
                        focuses on “biocultural diversity,” a term they popularized, which expresses how “biodiversity,
                        cultural diversity and linguistic diversity are all bound together.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Data on the world’s languages was difficult to come across at the time. One of the only
                        comprehensive databases was The Ethnologue, which began cataloging languages in 1951. Languages
                        change rapidly, and not everyone agrees on where one ends, and another one begins. So
                        Terralingua created the Index of Linguistic Diversity, which it defines on its website as the
                        “first-ever quantitative measure of trends in the world’s linguistic diversity.” It showed that
                        between 1970 and 2005, global linguistic diversity had declined by an estimated 20%, with
                        Indigenous languages most affected. This data taken alongside biodiversity data reveals a
                        striking observation. The trends in language loss closely mirrored the decline in global
                        biodiversity. The World Wildlife Fund’s Living Planet Index found that in that same time period,
                        plant and animal species had shrunk by an average of 27%.

                        Loh, a scientist specializing in global biological and cultural diversity, that suggested
                        connections between the state of the world’s linguistic diversity and the state of biodiversity.
                        In 2012, a study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), revealed
                        that biodiversity hotspots and high-biodiversity wilderness areas are home to 70% of the world’s
                        languages. It also highlighted that many of these languages are endemic to their regions and at
                        risk of extinction, and noted the parallel declines in global linguistic and biological
                        diversity.

                        “What we were able to show was that about three-quarters of the languages on the planet are
                        spoken in areas that contain high biodiversity, which is about one-fourth of the land surface,
                        excluding Antarctica,” says Larry Gorenflo, co-author of the study and professor of landscape
                        architecture, geography, African studies and anthropology at The Pennsylvania State University.
                        “Some of these biodiversity hotspots are just completely off the charts in terms of how much
                        linguistic diversity they have.”

                        Linguistic diversity can be seen as an indicator of cultural diversity more broadly, Gorenflo
                        says, which has traditionally been more difficult to define. “For a long time, anthropology was
                        considered to be the social science that studied culture. But nobody could come to an agreement
                        about what culture was,” he says. “Linguistic diversity is really what we’re using as a proxy
                        for cultural diversity.”

                        The exact reasons behind the connections between languages and nature are not entirely clear,
                        Gorenflo told me. Previous studies have suggested that areas with a high number of resources
                        create linguistic diversity because people must adapt to more complex environments. But others
                        have argued that it’s because more plentiful resources reduce the likelihood of having to share
                        them and communicate with neighboring groups in times of need. Meanwhile, some research has
                        suggested that the reasons behind this co-occurrence are far more complex and differ from one
                        area to another. Gorenflo emphasized the need for more research. “Understanding this connection
                        is important because it would change how we manage the relationship between Indigenous people
                        and biological diversity — and nature.”

                    <h4>Languages and Ecological Wisdom</h4>
                    <p>
                        Linguists estimate there are around 8,324 languages in the world, of which, according to
                        Ethnologue, 7,164 are still spoken today. However, the distribution of the world’s population
                        across these languages is uneven. More than half of the world’s 8 billion people speak one of
                        just 25 languages. Most of the remaining 7,139 languages have only a few speakers. About half of
                        all languages are spoken by communities of 10,000 or fewer people, while hundreds have just 10
                        or fewer speakers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        According to Ethnologue’s executive editor, Gary Simmons, a language dies roughly every 40 days.
                        Linguist Kenneth Hale has described losing just one language as equivalent to “dropping a bomb
                        on the Louvre” because of the culture and “intellectual wealth” contained in each of them. The
                        rate of language death is expected to increase as children stop learning them and older speakers
                        die out. Most languages vanished without a trace because, for most of human history, they were
                        exclusively oral. Yet it’s these endangered languages that reveal the beauty of human diversity
                        and the flexibility of the human mind. Some specialize in talking about herbal medicine,
                        astronomy or seaweed.

                        Languages are repositories of wisdom passed down through generations, and often that wisdom is
                        ecological. In western Canada and the United States, phrases in Indigenous languages indicate
                        when wild plants should be harvested. Indigenous Australians define seasons based on signals
                        like the flowering native trees, which in turn inform their fire management techniques to
                        control wildfires. Traditional Sámi calendars have 13 months based on plants and animal activity
                        of a particular time of year, such as miessemánnu (reindeer calf month) and borgemánnu
                        (reindeer-coat-shifting month). But it’s perhaps the Lakota phrase “Mitákuye Oyás’iŋ,” meaning
                        both “all my relatives” (human and non-human) and “all is related,” that best encapsulates the
                        interconnectedness of humans and nature.

                    <p>
                        Many endangered languages express reverence and respect for nature and an awareness of the
                        balance that must be maintained. “For communities that have an intimate connection with the
                        local environment, the land is the teacher. You have to learn the lessons of the land to survive
                        and thrive, and all of that, of course, gets encoded in your value system, which is expressed
                        through language,” Maffi told me. “Nowhere are you going to find a philosophy that says, ‘take
                        as much as you want and damn the future.’”
                    </p>
                    <h4>Language As A Colonizing Tool</h4>
                    <p>
                        The remarkable concentration of languages in the world’s most biologically diverse regions —
                        particularly the tropics and areas near the equator — may be partly explained by the protective
                        role of these wilderness areas against colonization. Historically, language death was frequently
                        driven by colonialism, and as Alfred Crosby argues in “Ecological Imperialism,” European
                        colonizers generally favored temperate areas with flat, arable land that was easier to settle
                        and farm.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In contrast, tropical regions posed more challenges, including diseases Europeans were more
                        vulnerable to because they lacked immunity. Isolated areas that are difficult to access also
                        tend to be more diverse. “Mountains and islands are where you find a lot of biodiversity. And if
                        they are hard places to move around in, you’ll find a fair amount of cultural diversity as
                        well,” Gorenflo adds.
                    </p>
                    <h6>
                        By the early 20th century, centuries of colonialism had claimed around 20% of the Indigenous
                        languages of Australia, the U.S., South Africa, and Argentina.
                    </h6>
                    <p>
                        By eradicating their mother tongues, colonizers disconnected local populations from their
                        culture, memory, sense of communal identity and relationship to the land, which had now also
                        been taken away from them. “Language, any language, has a dual character: it is both a means of
                        communication and a carrier of culture,” Kenyan novelist Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o wrote. It also
                        stopped them from passing on their knowledge to the next generation. A “colonizing [of] the
                        mind,” as Ngũgĩ famously put it.

                    <p>
                        Today, language loss is often a consequence of what many people living in industrialized
                        societies might describe as “progress”: intermarriage, the instruction of more “popular”
                        languages in schools and immigration for better opportunities. Indigenous languages can be hard
                        to maintain once speakers are immersed in new lives and their languages are no longer being used
                        within their intended contexts.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Conservation and Indigenous Knowledge</h4>
                    <p>
                        Paradoxically, the idea that humans are separate from nature has also been central to the
                        ideology around conservation. During a trip to the United States in 1919, King Albert I of
                        Belgium visited three of the country’s national parks: Yellowstone, Yosemite and the Grand
                        Canyon. It was just a few years after President Woodrow Wilson signed an act creating a National
                        Park Service, intended to protect 35 national parks and monuments. King Albert, inspired by what
                        he had seen across the Atlantic, decided to create his own park a few years later in 1925, which
                        he named The Albert National Park in the Belgian Congo. Now known as the Virunga National Park,
                        located in the Congo, it is considered the first national park to be established on the African
                        continent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The concept of a “national park” emerged from a 19th-century conservation movement rooted in the
                        idea that nature should be separated and protected from the people who live within it. The
                        Belgian authorities claimed only around 300 people lived in the park, but they, in fact,
                        violently pushed out thousands of Hutus and Tutsis from the area. Over the years, its
                        biodiversity has been threatened by conflict, deforestation, poaching and oil and gas drilling,
                        while its “fortress” conservation model (environments that are kept untouched by human
                        influence) has been criticized for preventing local populations from accessing its resources.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A similar story unfolded a few decades earlier in the valley now known as Yosemite. When the
                        naturalist John Muir arrived in 1868, he marveled at its stunning landscape, unaware that its
                        beauty was the result of careful management by the Ahwahneechee, a mixed tribe of Northern
                        Paiutes and Southern Sierra Miwoks. These communities, who spoke languages that reflected a deep
                        understanding of local plants and animals, were violently displaced by the Mariposa Battalion
                        led by James Savage in 1851.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the national park was created, based on Muir’s idea of “pure wilderness,” their way of
                        life was increasingly restricted. Indigenous inhabitants were moved to a village named Indian
                        Canyon, which was eventually destroyed and its inhabitants evicted. In her book “Savage Dreams,”
                        Rebecca Solnit writes that by 1969, “the original goal of the Mariposa Battalion was coming
                        closer to realization: eviction of the Ahwaneechee from the valley after their millennia there.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, only 400 people still speak the Northern Paiute language, while the Southern Sierra Miwok
                        language has dwindled to just a handful of speakers. Meanwhile, studies have since shown that
                        their removal led to ecological decline. A 1996 report by the Sierra Nevada Ecosystem Project
                        concluded that there was “an ecological ‘vacuum,’ or disequilibrium, in the Sierra Nevada,
                        resulting from the departure of Native Americans from managing these ecosystems.” The removal of
                        Indigenous communities, along with their land management techniques – often justified in the
                        name of conservation – has likely exacerbated environmental degradation, such as devastating
                        wildfires like those seen recently in Los Angeles.

                        growing recognition that Indigenous peoples and local communities are the best stewards of their
                        land.

                        “If you lose the language, that’s one of the pieces of the puzzle that will cause the connection
                        to collapse. The people who speak those languages in many cases followed traditional behavior,
                        and those traditional behaviors — in terms of landscape management and resource use, and even
                        conservation in some cases — end up benefitting the biodiversity world.”

                    <p>
                        Of course, most Indigenous land has not been lost to national parks, but to mass agriculture and
                        urban sprawl. In the Sonoran Desert, the decline of plants such as mesquite and cottonwood has
                        impacted the traditional ceremonies of the Indigenous Yoeme communities, who depend on the
                        natural world for many of their rituals. Their knowledge of the Sonoran landscape is featured in
                        many of the Yoeme’s songs, but as these areas become more built-up and plants disappear, the
                        songs lose their meaning and, consequently, are no longer passed on to future generations.

                    <p>
                        Maffi sees the abundance of languages, cultures and biodiversity in an area as interdependent
                        elements that mutually benefit each other. Thus, preserving the world’s languages could also be
                        considered a vital tool in combatting the climate crisis.

                        guidance. In traditional Hawaiian belief, the honu is an ‘aumakua, a personal or family god, or
                        a deified ancestor. Many ‘aumakua are animals, but also plants — a tradition that echoes how the
                        Lakota view other living beings as “relatives.”

                        As well as these traditions, the Hawaiian language is essential to the island’s identity. But
                        both suffered devastating declines in the 20th century: honu populations plummeted due to
                        overharvesting, while the Hawaiian language almost disappeared under a law that made English the
                        language of instruction in all public and private schools until 1987. During this time, students
                        were punished and shamed for speaking Hawaiian.

                        In recent decades, however, both have become central to the revitalization of Hawaiian culture.
                        Honu nesting populations have grown by 5% annually over the last 20 years, while the number of
                        Hawaiian speakers has increased dramatically (from 1,500 in 1980 to 18,000 in 2016) in the same
                        period, thanks to programs and fluency among younger generations. Biodiversity and language
                        represent the intertwined recovery of Hawaii’s natural and cultural heritage, each playing a
                        vital role in reconnecting Hawaiians to their ancestral traditions and identity.

                        On the Japanese island of Okinoerabu, speakers of Shimamuni — a local variety of the Kunigami
                        language that is classified as “definitely endangered” — began a school project in which
                        children gather for a daily beach cleanup while singing in their language and keeping a diary.
                        Aside from being more effective than teaching in a classroom, the use of the language in this
                        way was found to improve the efficiency of communication about environmental issues with elderly
                        islanders, some of whom mistakenly thought litter could degrade on its own. This example shows
                        the risks of losing intergenerational communication, which can have detrimental effects on the
                        entire community.

                    <h4>The Importance Of Multilingualism</h4>
                    <p>
                        Without revitalization efforts, academics estimate language loss could triple within 40 years,
                        with linguists predicting the disappearance of 50 to 90% of the world’s languages by the end of
                        this century, resulting in dire consequences for speaker communities, the scientific community
                        and human heritage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The fact that students with a greater average number of years of schooling are more likely to
                        experience language loss indicates that this rapid decline is rooted in a monolingual mindset.
                        Though multilingualism is the dominant human experience (around 60% of the world’s population
                        speaks more than one language), many countries see themselves as monolingual nation-states,
                        where a single language is considered key to preserving a sense of national identity. “The idea
                        of not only national but also linguistic unity and uniformity really came with the creation of
                        the nation-state in modern times,” Maffi told me. “We need to counter the idea that
                        multilingualism is the enemy.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For too long, the narrative around languages has been that the dominant language should replace
                        supposedly less “desirable” ones, rather than foster their coexistence. The belief that
                        bilingual children will be confused or struggle with learning multiple languages at once is a
                        misconception that has been widely debunked by research. In fact, studies consistently show the
                        numerous cognitive benefits of multilingualism. So if the world’s thousands of “smaller”
                        languages are to survive, a different approach is urgently needed — one that moves away from
                        monolingualism as the norm, and toward a recognition that what makes a language “useful” is not
                        necessarily determined by its number of speakers.

                        Languages, as Ralph Waldo Emerson put it in “The Poet,” are “archives of history.” Linguist
                        Nicholas Evans wrote that “they tell us not only about human cognition but also about the rich
                        tapestry of human experiences over millennia.” In losing them we risk losing not just a big
                        chunk of human history, but also the ability to understand different ways of seeing and living
                        in the world.

                        After pondering the interconnectedness between language and nature, Utsi, the reindeer herder,
                        comes up with another Northern Sámi word that encapsulates how his language is uniquely suited
                        to its environment. “Guorban is a word we use that means ‘overgrazed’ to a point where the
                        lichens will disappear. So basically, you don’t want to guorbadit [overgraze], because then you
                        will destroy that grazing for the next generation,” he told me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “There are constructions in the Sámi languages that give a precise description of how to use the
                        land, what to do in certain conditions, what reindeer need, and also what not to do, in order to
                        maintain the ecosystems. We have terminology that conveys careful use of the resources that we
                        need.”

                        For Gorenflo, the factors driving the co-occurrence of linguistic and biological diversity,
                        which were initially puzzling, are now becoming even more evident. “I see languages as an
                        extension of the cultural system, which itself is part of the broader ecology of the world,” he
                        told me. “So, it’s less and less of a mystery to me, and more about exploring what this ecology
                        looks like.”

                        The preservation of endangered languages is about more than saving words — it could be vital to
                        safeguarding centuries of human knowledge and understanding the systems that sustain us.
